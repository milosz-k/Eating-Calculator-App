## How to start?
### Option 1
Download TheEatingCalculator.exe from this repository and run this file.
I'm aware that .exe file is using my personal tokens. In this case these tokens are free, so I decided to give open acces to this .exe file to show this application's working nature.

### Option 2
Download whole repository and modify the env.template file with your own tokens. Acces to these tokens is free and available by this site: https://developer.nutritionix.com/signup
After modifying .env.template file, change filename to just .env and then you can run `python src/main.py`.
